# PSuSB

PSuSB is a small voltage regulator PCB, designed to provide a 5V USB socket from an LED-style 12/24V power supply. The goal is to provide a suitable power supply for 3D printer control electronics when running without a PC / laptop, without running any other external cabling (phone charger etc). This could be handy to power a Raspberry Pi (or similar) to operate the printer.
